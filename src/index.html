    <h1>Accessible Conference Calls</h1>
    <p>
        For many people, participating in conference calls is a challenge. They may
        be hard of hearing or better at processing text then voice. With the significant
        increase of people working from home, conference calling, while already prolific,
        is becoming even more so. Both video conferencing and traditional voice conferencing
        almost always provide a phone number to dial in to.

        Some conference calling services provide real time closed captioning, but some don't.
        This application is meant to:
        <ul>
            <li>bridge the gap for services that do not provide real time captioning</li>
            <li>allow for privacy regarding your special needs (no one needs to
                know you have captioning or need it)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p id="dialer">
        <form id="dial-form" action="dial" method="post">
                Please enter the number you would like to call:
                <input name="number" type="text" />
                <input value="dial" type="submit" />
        </form>
    </p>
    <p id="dialing-status" />

            webSocket = new WebSocket(socketTarget);
            webSocket.onmessage = function (msg) {
                const data = JSON.parse(msg.data);
                if (data.event === "interim-transcription") {

                var $form = $(this),
                    url = $form.attr("action");
                var posting = $.post(url, $form.serialize());
